# DEPractice

A structured repository dedicated to mastering real-world Data Engineering use cases through hands-on implementation using SQL and PySpark.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository is a daily practice initiative focused on solving practical data engineering scenarios.  
Each use case is implemented using:

- SQL
- PySpark
- Optimization & performance analysis

The goal is to think beyond syntax and build strong engineering intuition.

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

Each use case contains:

- `problem.md` → Clear business scenario
- `solution.sql` → SQL implementation
- `solution_pyspark.py` → PySpark implementation
- `notes.md` → Performance insights, edge cases, and optimization discussion

We treat every scenario as a production-level problem.
